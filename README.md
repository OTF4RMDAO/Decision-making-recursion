# Decision Making & Recursion Project

This project contains JavaScript implementations for tasks involving **Decision Making** (if-else & switch statements) and **Recursion**. The goal is to create solutions to the following tasks:

### Decision-Making Tasks:
- **Leap Year Checker**: Determines if a given year is a leap year.
- **Ticket Pricing**: Determines the price of a movie ticket based on the user's age.
- **Weather Clothing Adviser**: Advises what to wear based on temperature and rain conditions.

### Recursion Tasks:
- **Fibonacci Sequence**: Calculates the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.
- **Palindrome Checker**: Checks if a string is a palindrome using recursion.
- **Power Function**: Calculates the result of raising a number to a given power using recursion.
